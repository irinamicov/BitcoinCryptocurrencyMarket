# Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market

Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang). Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future. In fact, on the 6th of December of 2017, Bitcoin has a market capitalization above $200 billion.

This project was made available through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), where I completed it to solidify my knowledge after finishing the Data Analyst with Python Career Track. The dataset is from the end of 2017. However, despite being outdated at the moment of writing this, it still offers quite interesting data to explore many questions pertaining to over 1000 cryptocurrencies.

## Some of the questions answered in this project:

-	How big is Bitcoin compared to the rest of the cryptocurrencies?
-	How do cryptocurrencies chance over the course of 24 hours and 7 days?
-	Who are the top 10 winners and top 10 losers when it comes to cryptocurrency volatility?
-	Which size of coin dominates the cryptocurrency market?

To complete this project, I used techniques such as **importing and cleaning data, data manipulation and data visualization** using **Python’s pandas and Matplotlib**.
