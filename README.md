# Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market

Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang). Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may potentially become extremely valuable in the future. 

This project explores the market capitalisation of different cryptocurrencies. I completed it on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)'s platform as a way to solidify my knowledge after finishing their [Data Analyst with Python Career Track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-python). The dataset used in the project is from the end of 2017. However, despite being outdated at the moment of writing this, it still offers fascinating data allowing us to analyse many questions pertaining to over 1000 cryptocurrencies.

## Some of the questions answered in this project:

-   How big is Bitcoin compared to the rest of the cryptocurrencies?
-   How do cryptocurrencies change over the course of 24 hours and 7 days?
-   Who are the top 10 winners and top 10 losers when it comes to cryptocurrency volatility?
-   Which size of coin (based on market cap) dominates the cryptocurrency market: big, micro or nano?

To complete this project, I used techniques such as **importing and cleaning data, data manipulation and data visualisation** using **Pythonâ€™s pandas and Matplotlib**.
